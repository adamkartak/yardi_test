	MODIFIED
		06/11/2012	I removed the inner joins on the transaction tables to
				correctly report the toll log counts when invoices or
				batch headers have been deleted. I also removed the filter
				options for everything but the dates created, tweaked the
				date arithmetic to account for items entered after mid-
				night on the limit of the range, and provided a Columns
				section so you can run the report to screen without the
				Crystal file for exporting and troubleshooting.

	MODIFIED
		01/01/2016 I have changed almost everything from the original report. 
		The original was using aptolllog, and not cross refrencing rpayscaninvoice.
		I have rewritten the select statment to avoid the use of aptolllog since that is
		known to have issues. I did not touch the original "columns" section as this does 
		not effect the output of this report. The tables rpayscaninvoice, and rpayscanbatch 
		should be going through some maintance which will allow me to add more information
		to this report (mainly marking expidited invoices, and scan dates). I know there are 
		some typos in what i have called certain parameters and other items, but i have made 
		sure they are consistant in both this file and the RDLC used along with it.

		02/05/2016 Had to account for a couple complexities. One being when an entry in 
		rPayScanInvoice has a '0' for both hPayscanir and hPayscanbatch columns. This 
		happens when something goes wrong when full service tries to push it to the 
		Payscan DBs so we will not count these. Also found that if there are invoices 
		that client has not deleted, nor puit in any detail line information they were not showing
		on the list of invoices. was able to avoid this issue by changing "join" to 
		"left outer join" when connecting the sub-select that will note if an Ir has multiple
		properties on it. Also added another coulmn 'Deleted?' to better organise the IRs
